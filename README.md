# üé¨ IMDB SQL Analysis Project

This project performs in-depth analysis of the IMDB movie dataset using **SQL** queries. It is structured around business-relevant questions related to production houses, movie genres, actor/actress performance, box office revenues, and more, with the goal of supporting data-driven decision-making for a movie production company (RSVP Movies).

## üß© Key Tables Analyzed

- `movie`
- `genre`
- `ratings`
- `names`
- `director_mapping`
- `role_mapping`

## üìä Major Insights Extracted

- Yearly and monthly trends in movie releases
- Genre popularity and duration trends
- Production houses with the most hit or multilingual films
- Ranking of actors/actresses based on rating performance
- Identification of top-rated movies, directors, and companies
- Movie classification by success (Superhit, Hit, Flop)
- Rolling averages and running totals by genre

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used

- **SQL** (MySQL-compatible syntax)
- `INFORMATION_SCHEMA` for metadata queries
- Window functions: `RANK()`, `DENSE_RANK()`, `ROW_NUMBER()`, `LEAD()`
- Aggregate functions: `AVG()`, `COUNT()`, `SUM()`, `MIN()`, `MAX()`
- Conditional logic via `CASE WHEN`

## üìå Use Cases

This project supports:

- Strategic planning for new movie production
- Talent scouting (top actors, directors)
- Genre targeting based on audience response
- Partner identification among production companies
- Time series analysis of movie trends

## üöÄ Getting Started

To run this project:

1. Import the IMDB dataset into your SQL environment.
2. Open and execute `IMDB+question.sql` in your SQL client (e.g., MySQL Workbench, DBeaver, pgAdmin).
3. Review the output to interpret insights or export results for reporting.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Notes

- Make sure your database schema is named `imdb` (as used in the SQL file).
- Some queries use functions like `POSITION()` and `DATEDIFF()` ‚Äî ensure compatibility with your SQL engine.
- Clean and load data with proper data types (especially dates and numeric columns).

## üèÅ Outcome

By the end of this project, users gain a detailed understanding of the structure, performance, and business opportunities within the IMDB dataset, enabling strategic decision-making for content production and investment.
